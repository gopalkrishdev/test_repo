Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on massive text data.

They learn patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning from that data.

LLMs use deep learning, mainly Transformer architecture.

Transformers rely on self-attention to understand context.

Self-attention helps models focus on relevant words in a sentence.

LLMs generate human-like text responses.

They can answer questions, summarize content, and translate languages.

They work by predicting the next token in a sequence.

A token is a chunk of text — a word or part of a word.

Millions or billions of parameters shape the model’s behavior.

Parameters are the model’s learnable weights.

More parameters generally mean better capability.

LLMs are trained using large datasets from the internet, books, and more.

Training requires huge compute resources.

GPUs and TPUs are commonly used for training.

After training, models are fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Fine-tuning improves performance in narrow domains.

Instruction tuning makes the model follow directions better.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns the model with human expectations.

Safety layers help avoid harmful or biased output.

LLMs can perform zero-shot learning.

Zero-shot means doing tasks without prior examples.

Few-shot learning allows better performance using small examples.

Prompt engineering improves output quality.

Prompts guide the model on how to behave.
